2025-09-02 02:40:11.544372 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Building 'etcd3' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'etcd3'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334

2025-09-02 02:40:21.308034 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Building 'pyinotify' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'pyinotify'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334

2025-09-02 02:40:35.733307 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of keystone==25.0.1.dev14 from file:///opt/stack/keystone (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information.

2025-09-02 02:40:55.993731 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Building 'ncclient' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'ncclient'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334

2025-09-02 02:40:56.470902 | controller |   ERROR: Failed building wheel for ovs
2025-09-02 02:40:56.471595 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Building 'logutils' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'logutils'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334
