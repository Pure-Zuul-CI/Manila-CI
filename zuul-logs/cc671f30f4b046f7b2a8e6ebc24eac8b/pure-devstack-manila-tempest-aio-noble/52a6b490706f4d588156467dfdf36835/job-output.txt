2025-08-02 05:12:14.818547 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Building 'testresources' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'testresources'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334

2025-08-02 05:18:02.249270 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of python-manilaclient==5.5.1.dev3 from file:///opt/stack/python-manilaclient (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information.

2025-08-02 05:18:54.670647 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of manila-tempest-plugin==2.7.1.dev27 from file:///opt/stack/manila-tempest-plugin (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information.

2025-08-02 05:23:06.036242 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of tempest==44.0.1.dev15 from file:///opt/stack/tempest (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457
